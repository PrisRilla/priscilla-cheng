## Prerequisites
- Install Xcode (via Apple App store)
- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for package management as sudo and curl pose more of security risk because you are running the script directly. Choosing the wrong script can run poorly. Installing homebrew also downloads the Xcode command line package for you
- Make sure you have node and npm installed

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
