                     department</li>
                 <li>Abstract: The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act places an excise tax 1.4% on net investment income of private universities with more than $500,000 endowment per student and with minimum 500 tuition paying students. The initial hypothesis is that the tax will have an economic impact on students, with the risk possibly reducing funds available for financial aid. After preliminary exploration, this study finds that the money available for scholarships is not affected. An exploration from the Great Financial Crisis, used as a model for the anticipated financial strain resulting from the excise tax, finds financial strain to have no near term effect on aid funding and enrollment. Ultimately, the notion that the excise tax affects student aid through university actions is false as it seems that universities hold a high degree of priority for scholarships/aid and would seek alternative solutions to financial tightening.</li>
